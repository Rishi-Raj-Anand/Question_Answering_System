# Question Answering System with Hugging Face

This project demonstrates a simple, extractive Question Answering (QA) system using the Hugging Face `transformers` library and the `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad` model.

The `code.ipynb` notebook loads the model, defines a text context (about the Eiffel Tower), and answers a list of questions based on that context.

## Dependencies

All necessary dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

Install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## How to Use

1. Install dependencies (see above).

2. Run the `code.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.

3. Modify the `context` or `questions` variables in the notebook to experiment.
